**What is a “Sample Size”?**

A sample size is a part of the population chosen for a survey or experiment. For example, you might take a survey of dog owner’s brand preferences. You won’t want to survey all the millions of dog owners in the country (either because it’s too expensive or time consuming), so you take a sample size. That may be several thousand owners. The sample size is a representation of all dog owner’s brand preferences. If you choose your sample wisely, it will be a good representation.

A census is where every member of a population is surveyed, not just a sample.

**When Error can Creep in?**

When you only survey a small sample of the population, uncertainty creeps in to your statistics. If you can only survey a certain percentage of the true population, you can never be 100% sure that your statistics are a complete and accurate representation of the population. This uncertainty is called sampling error and is usually measured by a confidence interval. For example, you might state that your results are at a 90% confidence level. That means if you were to repeat your survey over and over, 90% of the time your would get the same results.

### How to find a sample size?

1. Conduct a census if you have a small population. A “small” population will depend on your budget and time constraints. For example, it may take a day to take a census of a student body at a small private university of 1,000 students but you may not have the time to survey 10,000 students at a large state university.
1. Use a sample size from a similar study. Chances are, your type of study has already been undertaken by someone else. You’ll need access to academic databases to search for a study (usually your school or college will have access). A pitfall: you’ll be relying on someone else correctly calculating the sample size. Any errors they have made in their calculations will transfer over to your study.
1. Use a table to find your sample size. If you have a fairly generic study, then there is probably a table for it. For example, if you have a clinical study, you may be able to use a table published in [Machin et. al’s Sample Size Tables for Clinical Studies, Third Edition](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/book/10.1002/9781444300710).
1. Use a [sample size calculator](http://www.nss.gov.au/nss/home.nsf/pages/Sample+size+calculator).
1. Use a formula. There are many different formulas you can use, depending on what you know (or don’t know) about your population. If you know some parameters about your population (like a known standard deviation), you can use the techniques below. If you don’t know much about your population, use [Slovin’s formula](https://www.statisticshowto.com/how-to-use-slovins-formula/).
